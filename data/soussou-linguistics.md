# Soussou Language - Linguistic Research

**Research Date**: 2025-11-15
**Agent**: Linguistic Research Agent
**Purpose**: Foundation for Soussou AI language model

## 1. Language Classification

### Language Family
**Niger-Congo → Mande** (with classification dispute)

**Traditional Classification (Ethnologue)**:
- Susu belongs to the Niger-Congo language family
- Specifically: **Mande branch** of Niger-Congo languages
- Sub-group: **Western Mande**
- Dialect cluster: **Susu-Yalunka** (Soso-Jalonke)

**Alternative Classification (Glottolog)**:
- Glottolog considers **Mande as an independent language family**, separate from Niger-Congo
- Rationale: Mande has not yet been shown to contain systematic sound correspondences, noun class systems, or verbal extensions with Niger-Congo
- Glottocode: **susu1250**
- ISO 639-3: **sus**

**Closest Relative**:
- **Yalunka** (also spelled Dialonké, Jalonke) - mutually intelligible with Susu
- The Susu language is almost indistinguishable from Yalunka
- Both speak a dialect of **Susu-Yalunka** known to Susu people as **Sosoxui**

**Historical Relationship**:
The close linguistic relationship supports the theory that Susu and Yalunka were once members of the same tribe, separated by Fula invaders who forced the Susu southward.

### Related Languages
**Within Western Mande**:
- Mandinka (Mandingo)
- Mende
- Vai
- Kakabe

**Typological Note**: Mande languages, including Susu, use SOV word order, contrasting with the typical Niger-Congo structure of SVO.

### Geographic Distribution

**Primary Regions**:
- **Guinea**: Predominantly in Guinée Maritime (Maritime Guinea/Lower Guinea)
  - Capital: **Conakry** (37% of population speaks Susu)
  - **Kindia Region** (54.9% speak Susu)
  - **Forecariah**
  - Coastal southwestern region
- **Sierra Leone**: Northwestern region, particularly Kambia District
- **Guinea-Bissau**: Smaller communities
- **Senegal**: Smaller communities

**Status**:
- One of the **national languages of Guinea**
- **Lingua franca** of Lower Guinea (Maritime Guinea)
- Almost everyone in the region speaks it either as first language or in addition to mother tongue
- Serves as major **trade language** along the Guinean coast

## 2. Phonology

### Vowels

**Inventory**: **7 vowel phonemes**
- /a/ (open central)
- /e/ (close-mid front)
- /i/ (close front)
- /o/ (close-mid back)
- /u/ (close back)
- /ɛ/ (open-mid front)
- /ɔ/ (open-mid back)

**Vowel Length**:
- Vowels can be either **short or long**
- Vowel length is **phonemically contrastive** (changes word meaning)
- Long vowels are represented as double vowels in orthography

**Example**:
The letter "ɛ" represents a specific vowel sound not found in standard Latin alphabets (used in Susu orthography since 1988/1989 standardization)

### Consonants

**Inventory includes**:
- Stops
- Nasals (including prenasalized consonants)
- Fricatives
- Approximants

**Notable Features**:
- **Prenasalized consonants**: ǹgá 'mother' is the only noun in Susu with an initial prenasalized consonant
- **Nasal codas possible**: màsà(ŋ) 'chief' - shows nasal can be syllable coda

**Consonant Clusters**:
Evidence suggests clusters exist (based on observed spellings like "kh", "gb", "gn" in related contexts), but specific inventory requires access to Houis (1963) for complete description.

### Tonality

**CRITICAL FINDING: YES, Susu is TONAL**

**Tone System**: **Binary (2-tone) system**
- **High (H)**
- **Low (L)**

**Basic Tonal Melodies** (for disyllabic nouns):
- **HH** (both syllables high)
- **HL** (high-low falling contour)
- **LH** (low-high rising contour)

**Complex Patterns**:
- HLH, LHL for longer words

**Tone Bearing Unit (TBU)**:
- The **mora** (not the syllable)
- This allows intricate tonal behavior across phonemically long vowels

**Tonal Processes**:

1. **Neutralization-by-Copy (NBC)**:
   - When compounds form, the final lexical tone of the first element copies to the first TBU of the second element
   - Applies differently based on first element's melody

2. **Affaissement (AFF)** (Tone Lowering):
   - Low tones spread rightward within a tonal foot domain when followed by High-tone words
   - Creates all-Low melodies where rising patterns would otherwise appear

3. **Tone Raising (RAI)**:
   - High tones spread within defined prosodic domains
   - Converts expected patterns to all-High sequences

**Process Interaction Example**:
/LH + XX/ → [LL.HL] - appears to violate NBC principles, but both NBC and AFF apply transparently; their combined outcome obscures the intermediate step

**Function**:
- Tone **distinguishes lexical items** fundamentally
- Different underlying melodies yield different surface forms and semantic identities
- Operates across singular, plural, and compound nominal constructions

**Tonal Compactness (TC)**:
- Process in which lexical tonal melody of morphologically complex words and some phrases (compounds, noun+modifier constructions) is neutralized
- Susu exhibits different outcomes of tonal compactness possible in Mande languages

**Writing**:
- Tone indication appears to be **optional** in written Susu
- Academic descriptions (Touré 1994) use tone marking in glossed examples

### Syllable Structure

**Basic Pattern**:
- **CV** (consonant-vowel) - primary pattern typical of Mande languages
- Mande words frequently have **CVCV** pattern

**Evidence of CVC**:
- Nasal codas confirmed: màsà**(ŋ)** 'chief'
- At least limited CVC syllable structures exist

**Comparison to Related Languages**:
- "Standard" Bamana (closely related Mande) permits only maximal CV syllables
- Colloquial Bamana has developed complex CCV and CVC syllable shapes

**Gap**: Full syllable structure constraints require access to Houis (1963) "Étude descriptive de la langue Susu" for complete specification.

## 3. Morphology

### Verb Formation

**Key Characteristics**:
- **No agreement affixes on the verb**
- Verbs do not change form to agree with subject in person, number, or gender
- **Generally suffixing** language

**Verbal Prefixes** (documented):
- **mà-**: Described by Houis (1963) as "modalité itérative" (iterative modality)
- **rà-**: Described by Houis (1963) as "modalité intentionnelle" (intentional modality)

**French Verb Borrowing**:
- **QUESTION**: The -fé suffix pattern observed in preliminary data (adding -fé to French verbs)
- **STATUS**: Not confirmed in academic literature searched
- **HYPOTHESIS**: May be a productive borrowing adaptation strategy
- **REQUIRES FURTHER RESEARCH**: Peace Corps materials or field data needed to validate this pattern

**Aspect Marker**:
- **/bara/** - aspect marker (cognate with Yalunka **/bata/**)

### Pronoun System

**Status**: **Not fully documented** in available web sources

**Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction**:
- **UNLIKELY** based on typological patterns
- According to WALS (World Atlas of Language Structures), inclusive/exclusive distinction is "hardly found in West African, Bantu and Semitic languages"
- Some Sub-Saharan African languages do make the distinction (e.g., Fula)
- **REQUIRES VERIFICATION** through Peace Corps manual or grammar resources

**What We Know**:
- Susu is **non-pro-drop** (pronouns cannot be omitted)
- This means pronoun system is obligatory and likely well-developed

**Gap**: Complete pronoun inventory requires access to Peace Corps Susu Language Course PDF or Houis (1963).

### Noun System

**No Noun Classes**:
- Unlike many Niger-Congo languages, Susu has **no noun classes**

**No Gender**:
- Susu has **no grammatical gender**

**Plural Formation**:
- **Clitic plural marker** attaches to the **last element** of the Noun Phrase (NP)
- Can attach to N or D (typically)
- **Does not co-occur with numerals**

**Possession**:
- Word order: **Poss-N** (Possessor precedes Noun)

**Demonstratives**:
- Word order: **N-D** (Noun precedes Demonstrative)

**Articles**:
- Susu has **no definite or indefinite articles**

**Diminutivity**:
- Expression of diminutive meaning is documented in linguistic literature (academic papers on Academia.edu reference this)

### Derivational Processes

**Not extensively documented** in available sources. Requires academic grammar consultation.

**Sources**:
- Shluinsky, Andrey. "Verbal prefixes mà- and rà- in Susu and lexical features of verbs" (https://llacan.cnrs.fr/PDF/Mandenkan52/52shluinsky.pdf)
- Wikipedia: Susu language
- WALS Online: Various features

---

## 4. Syntax (Sentence Structure)

### Word Order

**Basic Order**: **SOV** (Subject-Object-Verb)

**Full Typological Profile**:
- SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)
- Poss-N (Possessor-Noun)
- N-D (Noun-Demonstrative)
- **Generally suffixing**
- **Non-pro-drop** (pronouns obligatory)
- **Wh-in-situ** (question words stay in original position)

**Flexibility**:
- **Likely relatively strict SOV** based on Mande family patterns
- SOV is characteristic of Western Mande languages: Mandinka, Susu, Mende, Vai
- Contrasts with typical Niger-Congo SVO structure

**Comparison**:
- The user's preliminary observation of **SOAM (Subject-Object-Action-Modifier)** aligns with **SOV** if "Action" = Verb
- The Modifier position after Verb is consistent with suffixing, post-verbal particles

### Question Formation

**WH-Questions**: **Wh-in-situ**

**Critical Feature**:
- Interrogative words **remain in their original position** in the sentence
- They do **NOT move to sentence-initial position** (unlike English)

**Example Pattern**:
- English: "**What** are you eating?" (WH-word moves to front)
- Susu pattern: "You are eating **what**?" (WH-word stays in place)

**This is significant for AI development**:
- Question generation must keep WH-words in their logical/semantic position
- No fronting transformation required

### Negation

**Negation Particle**: **mu**

**Distribution**:
- **Unclear** from available sources
- With adjectival predicates: "seems to sometimes infix"
- With transitive verbs: "comes before the object"

**User's Observation**:
- **m'ma** pattern observed in preliminary data
- May be contraction or variant of **mu** + additional particle
- **REQUIRES VERIFICATION** through Peace Corps manual

**General Strategy**:
- Sentential negation expressed with particle (not verb inflection)
- Consistent with isolating/analytic tendency of language

### Relative Clauses

**Not documented** in available sources. Requires academic grammar.

### Serial Verb Constructions

**Not documented** in available sources. Likely exist given Mande family membership, but requires verification.

### Inflection

**Minimal Use**:
- "Susu makes scarce use of inflection"
- Prefers to rely on **word order** and **particles** to tie together words in sentences
- Consistent with **analytic/isolating** language type

**Sources**:
- Wikipedia: Susu language
- WALS Online: Position of Interrogative Phrases (https://wals.info/chapter/93)

## 5. Writing System & Orthography

### Why No Standardized Spelling?

**Historical Reasons**:

1. **Oral Tradition Dominance**:
   - Susu was primarily an oral language for most of its history
   - Written tradition developed late compared to European languages

2. **Multiple Writing System Introductions**:
   - **Arabic script** (Ajami variant) - introduced during Imamate of Futa Jallon (Islamic influence, 17th-18th centuries)
   - **Latin script** - introduced by missionaries in early 19th century
   - **N'Ko script** - modern pan-Mande writing system
   - **Adlam script** - recent addition

3. **Colonial History**:
   - French colonial administration (Guinea)
   - British colonial administration (Sierra Leone)
   - Different orthographic conventions developed in different territories

4. **Late Standardization**:
   - First written by **John Godfrey Wilhelm** (German missionary, Church Mission Society) in **early 19th century**
   - Translated first seven chapters of Gospel of Matthew, published as "Lingjili Matthew" in London (1816)
   - **Government standardization** under Ahmed Sékou Touré (first President of Guinea)
   - **Guinean languages alphabet** adopted - formalized Latin orthography
   - **1988/1989**: Revised to adhere closer to **African reference alphabet**

5. **Current Situation**:
   - Standardization exists but **not universally adopted**
   - Multiple spelling traditions persist across regions and countries
   - **Tone marking is optional** - creates additional variation

### Orthographies Exist

**1. Latin Script** (most common):
- **Standardized version** (1988/1989): Uses African reference alphabet
- Includes diacritics: **ɛ** and **ɔ** for open-mid vowels
- Tone marking: Optional (academic texts mark tones, everyday writing often doesn't)
- Used in: Education, government publications (Guinea), religious materials

**2. Arabic Script (Ajami)**:
- Variant of Arabic script adapted for Susu
- Likely introduced during Imamate of Futa Jallon
- Used in: Islamic/Quranic education, religious contexts
- Less common in modern secular contexts

**3. N'Ko Script**:
- Modern script created by Solomana Kante (1949) for Mande languages
- Right-to-left writing direction
- Has built-in tone marking
- Used by: Some Mande language advocates, cultural preservation efforts

**4. Adlam Script**:
- Recently developed script for West African languages
- Used less commonly for Susu

### Common Spelling Variations & Why They Occur

**Language Name Variations**:
- **Susu** (most common in English linguistics)
- **Soussou** (French influence)
- **Soso**
- **Sosso**
- **Sosoxui** (endonym - what Susu people call their language)

**Why Variations Occur**:

1. **Tone Not Written**:
   - Tonal distinctions not represented in most orthographies
   - Same consonant-vowel sequence can represent different tones
   - Context must disambiguate

2. **Vowel Length Ambiguity**:
   - Long vowels sometimes written double (aa, ee), sometimes single
   - Inconsistent representation across texts

3. **Cross-Border Differences**:
   - Guinea (French colonial influence) vs. Sierra Leone (British influence)
   - Different orthographic conventions
   - French vs. English phonetic approximations

4. **Arabic Script Transfer**:
   - Speakers literate in Arabic may apply different phoneme-grapheme correspondences
   - Ajami orthography differs from Latin conventions

5. **Dialectal Pronunciation**:
   - Regional variation in pronunciation leads to variant spellings
   - Conakry vs. rural dialects may differ slightly

6. **Lack of Widespread Literacy in Susu**:
   - French is language of education in Guinea
   - English in Sierra Leone
   - Limited formal instruction in Susu orthography
   - Writers use intuitive spellings

- Wikipedia: Susu language
- Omniglot: Susu (https://www.omniglot.com/writing/susu.htm)

## 6. Sociolinguistic Context

### Speakers & Distribution

**Total Population**:
- **Over 2.2 million speakers** across all countries
- **2.4 million** cited in some sources

**By Country**:
- **Guinea**: Largest population - 21.2% of national population (~2-2.5 million)
  - Concentrated in Maritime Guinea (Lower Guinea)
  - 37% of Conakry population
  - 54.9% of Kindia Region population
- **Sierra Leone**: Northwestern region (smaller population, exact numbers not available)
- **Guinea-Bissau**: Small communities
- **Senegal**: Small communities

**Language Status**:
- **Stable indigenous language** (Ethnologue assessment)
- Not endangered
- **One of the national languages of Guinea** (alongside Pular/Fula, Maninka, others)
- **Lingua franca** of Lower Guinea/Maritime region

**Vitality**:
- Strong intergenerational transmission
- Used in trade, daily life, radio, religious contexts
- Bible translation completed (2017)

### Bilingualism & Code-Switching

**Bilingualism Patterns**:

1. **Susu + French** (most common in Guinea):
   - **French** = official language of Guinea, language of education, government, formal contexts
   - Urban areas (Conakry): High French-Susu bilingualism
   - Rural areas: Lower French proficiency
   - Education entirely in French → all educated Susu speakers are bilingual

2. **Susu + English** (in Sierra Leone):
   - English = official language
   - Similar pattern to Guinea with French

3. **Susu + Arabic** (religious contexts):
   - Quranic education common
   - Arabic literacy among religious scholars
   - Limited to religious/liturgical use

4. **Susu + Other African Languages**:
   - Pular/Fula (fellow Guinean language)
   - Mandinka (related Mande language)
   - In multilingual urban centers

**Code-Switching Norms**:

**Status**: **Under-researched** - no specific academic studies found on Susu-French code-switching

**Likely Patterns** (based on similar West African contexts):
- **Intra-sentential switching**: Common in bilingual urban speech
- **French lexical borrowing**: Technical terms, modern concepts, education/government vocabulary
- **Susu as matrix language**: In informal contexts, French words inserted
- **French as matrix language**: In formal/educated contexts, Susu words for cultural concepts
- **Domains**: French (education, work, government) vs. Susu (home, market, community)

**Attitudes** (inferred, not confirmed):
- Likely **NOT stigmatized** in informal contexts
- Code-switching is **normal** in multilingual West African societies
- Pure Susu valued in cultural/traditional contexts
- French proficiency = social mobility, education marker

**CRITICAL GAP**:
- No specific research found on Susu-French code-switching patterns
- No documentation of whether French verb + Susu suffix patterns are accepted/common
- Field research or sociolinguistic interviews needed

### Dialectal Variation

**Evidence**:
- Sources mention Susu is spoken across wide geographic area (Guinea, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal)
- **Lower Guinea/Maritime Guinea** is primary zone

**Specific Dialects**:
- **Not well-documented** in available sources
- No mentions of named dialects (e.g., "Conakry Susu" vs. "Kindia Susu")

**Susu-Yalunka Continuum**:
- Susu and Yalunka are **mutually intelligible**
- May represent dialect continuum rather than distinct languages
- Treated as single dialect cluster: **Susu-Yalunka** (Soso-Jalonke)

**Cross-Border Variation** (likely):
- Guinea vs. Sierra Leone: Different colonial languages (French vs. English)
- May have lexical differences from borrowings
- Orthographic differences certain

**Lingua Franca Effect**:
- As lingua franca of Lower Guinea, likely developing some **koineization**
- Leveling of features in urban/trade contexts
- More variation may exist in rural communities

**GAP**: Regional dialectology requires field research or access to specialized sources.

### Language Contact History

**Pre-Colonial**:
- Contact with other Mande languages (Mandinka, Mende, Vai)
- Contact with Fula/Pular (forced Susu-Yalunka split)
- Regional trade networks

**Islamic Period** (17th-18th centuries):
- **Susu people converted to Islam**
- **Arabic** influence through:
  - Quranic education
  - Islamic scholarship
  - Religious terminology
- Ajami script introduction

**Colonial Period**:
- **French colonization** (Guinea): 1890s-1958
  - French imposed as administrative/educational language
  - Massive French lexical influence
- **British colonization** (Sierra Leone): 1800s-1961
  - English administrative influence (less documentation for Susu)

**Post-Independence** (1958-present, Guinea):
- Ahmed Sékou Touré's language policies
  - Promotion of national languages
  - Standardization of orthographies (1988/1989)
  - Radio broadcasting in Susu
- Continued French dominance in education
- Increasing English influence (globalization, media)

## 7. Language Contact & Borrowing

### French Influence

**Extent**:
- **MASSIVE** - French is official language of Guinea
- All formal education conducted in French
- Government, media, technical domains

**Borrowing Domains**:
- Modern technology
- Education terminology
- Government/administration
- Modern commerce
- Abstract/academic concepts
- Numbers (likely French numerals used alongside Susu)

**Phonological Adaptation**:
- **NOT documented** in available sources
- **User's observation**: -fé suffix added to French verbs
- **HYPOTHESIS**: French verbs may be phonologically adapted to fit Susu CV(C) syllable structure
- **REQUIRES RESEARCH**: How are French consonant clusters handled? Final consonants?

**Examples Needed**:
- Peace Corps materials or fieldwork needed to document actual borrowing patterns

### Arabic Influence

**Historical Context**:
- Susu converted to Islam in **17th-18th centuries**
- Quranic education widespread
- Ajami script usage

**Borrowing Domains** (typical for Islamic influence):
- Religious terminology (prayer, mosque, religious practices)
- Islamic theology concepts
- Moral/ethical vocabulary
- Possibly: numbers, temporal expressions

**Evidence from Related Context**:
- Wikipedia notes: "Terms and social categories in the caste-based social stratification system of Susu people show cases of borrowing from Arabic" (though notes these may also be linked to Latin, Greek, or Aramaic)

**Status**:
- **Under-documented** in available sources
- Typical pattern in West African Islamic societies suggests substantial Arabic religious vocabulary
- Requires specialized lexical study

### Other African Language Influences

**Fula/Pular**:
- Neighboring language in Guinea
- Historical conflict (forced Susu-Yalunka split)
- Contact in multilingual regions
- Likely lexical exchange

**Mandinka**:
- Related Mande language
- Regional trade contacts
- Shared Mande vocabulary (difficult to distinguish borrowing from inheritance)

**Mende, Vai** (Sierra Leone):
- Contact in Sierra Leone Susu communities
- Extent not documented

### How Loanwords Are Adapted

**Phonological Adaptation**:
- **Not documented** in available sources
- **Hypothesis** (based on syllable structure):
  - French/Arabic consonant clusters may be broken up: CCV → CV.CV
  - Final consonants may be dropped or vowel added: CVC → CV.CV
  - Tones assigned to borrowings (which tone melody? unclear)

**Morphological Integration**:
- **Hypothesis**: Susu plural marker can attach to borrowings
- **Hypothesis**: Borrowed verbs integrated into Susu verb morphology (user's -fé observation)

**CRITICAL GAP**:
- No academic description of loanword phonology found
- Requires consultation of Houis (1963) or field research

**Sources**:
- Wikipedia: Susu people (Arabic influence note)
- General knowledge of colonial language policies

## Summary: Key Findings for AI Development

### **Tonal**: ✅ **YES - Binary (H/L) tone system**
- **Critical for phonetic normalization**: Tone distinguishes meaning
- **2 tones**: High, Low (combine into HH, HL, LH, HLH, LHL melodies)
- **Tonal processes**: Neutralization-by-Copy, Affaissement, Tone Raising
- **TBU = mora** (not syllable)
- **Written tone is optional** → variant mapping must account for tone-unmarked vs. tone-marked forms

### **Word Order**: ✅ **Strict SOV**
- **Subject-Object-Verb** (NOT SVO)
- User's "SOAM" pattern = SOV + post-verbal modifiers (suffixing)
- **Wh-in-situ**: Question words stay in place (no fronting)
- Affects sentence generation rules

### **-fé Productivity**: ❓ **UNCONFIRMED**
- User observation of -fé suffix on French verbs
- **NOT documented in academic literature searched**
- **Hypothesis**: Productive borrowing strategy
- **Action needed**: Analyze Peace Corps materials, validate in field data
- **Alternative**: May be code-switching, not morphological integration

### **Standard Orthography**: ⚠️ **EXISTS BUT NOT UNIVERSALLY ADOPTED**
- Official: 1988/1989 Guinean alphabet (African reference alphabet)
- Reality: Multiple traditions (Latin, Arabic, N'Ko, Adlam)
- Tone marking optional
- Cross-border differences (Guinea vs. Sierra Leone)
- **Implication**: Variant mapping essential; normalize to standard Latin form

### **Code-Switching**: ❓ **LIKELY NORMAL, BUT UNDER-RESEARCHED**
- No academic studies on Susu-French code-switching found
- Bilingualism universal in educated population (French = education/government)
- **Likely**: Code-switching not stigmatized in informal contexts
- **Likely**: French lexical borrowings common (technical, modern concepts)
- **Uncertain**: Morphological integration patterns (e.g., French verb + Susu suffix)
- **Action needed**: Sociolinguistic fieldwork or analysis of social media/informal texts

### **Morphological Features for AI**:
- **No verb agreement**: Verbs don't inflect for person/number/gender
- **No noun classes/gender**: Simplifies noun processing
- **Clitic plural**: Attaches to last NP element (not every noun)
- **Non-pro-drop**: Pronouns obligatory (unlike Spanish/Italian)
- **Suffixing**: Grammatical information added after stems
- **Minimal inflection**: Relies on word order + particles

### **Phonological Features for AI**:
- **7 vowels**: /a e i o u ɛ ɔ/ + length distinction
- **CV primary, limited CVC**: Syllable structure relatively simple
- **Nasal codas**: Possible (màsàŋ 'chief')
- **Tone**: Must be modeled (even if not written)

## Gaps in Knowledge

### Critical Gaps (Block AI Development):

1. **Complete Pronoun Inventory**
   - Need full list: 1sg, 2sg, 3sg, 1pl, 2pl, 3pl
   - Inclusive/exclusive distinction? (unlikely but unconfirmed)
   - Object pronouns? Possessive pronouns?
   - **Source needed**: Peace Corps PDF, Houis (1963)

2. **French Borrowing Morphology**
   - Is -fé suffix productive for French verbs?
   - How are French phonemes adapted? (consonant clusters, final consonants)
   - Which French verbs are borrowed vs. calqued?
   - **Source needed**: Sociolinguistic fieldwork, corpus analysis

3. **Negation System**
   - What is "m'ma"? (contraction of mu + ?)
   - Full negation paradigm
   - Scope of negation (sentence, constituent)
   - **Source needed**: Grammar, Peace Corps PDF

4. **Question Formation Details**
   - Wh-words: what, who, where, when, why, how?
   - Yes/no question formation (intonation only? particle?)
   - **Source needed**: Grammar, Peace Corps PDF

### Important Gaps (Limit Quality):

5. **Complete Phoneme Inventory**
   - Full consonant chart with IPA
   - Phonotactic constraints (allowed clusters, positions)
   - **Source needed**: Houis (1963), PHOIBLE data

6. **Syllable Structure Details**
   - Complete constraints (what can be onset, coda?)
   - Maximal syllable structure
   - **Source needed**: Houis (1963)

7. **Loanword Phonology**
   - How are non-Susu phonemes handled?
   - Tone assignment to borrowings
   - **Source needed**: Specialized research

8. **Dialectal Variation**
   - Regional dialects (if any)
   - Conakry vs. rural differences
   - Guinea vs. Sierra Leone differences
   - **Source needed**: Dialectology research, field surveys

9. **Aspect/Tense/Mood System**
   - How are tense/aspect expressed?
   - Verbal prefixes mà-, rà- (full paradigm?)
   - /bara/ aspect marker (function?)
   - **Source needed**: Grammar, linguistic papers

10. **Serial Verb Constructions**
    - Do they exist in Susu? (likely, given Mande membership)
    - Patterns and semantics
    - **Source needed**: Grammar, syntax papers

### Minor Gaps (Refinement):

11. **Stress Patterns** - not critical if tone is primary
12. **Relative Clause Formation** - syntax detail
13. **Arabic Loanword Inventory** - cultural/religious vocabulary
14. **Historical Phonology** - academic interest
15. **Sociolinguistic Attitudes** - community perceptions of code-switching, dialects
