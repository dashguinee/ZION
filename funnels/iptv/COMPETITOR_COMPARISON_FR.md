- Expensive equipment

DASH TV+ Premium: 35,000 GNF/month

## MESSAGING STRATEGY

### When Customer Has Cable
```
"You're paying 150k-200k for 50-100 channels with a big box.
DASH TV+ is 35k for 700+ channels on your phone.
That's 7x more content for 1/5th the price.

Plus no installation costs, no contracts, no landlord angry about external cable.
It's just... better. Full stop."
```

### When Customer Has Generic IPTV
```
"I get it - you already use IPTV. The question is: are you HAPPY?

Most people aren't because they're using some revendeur's generic app.
DASH TV+ is different - it's our app, our support, our standard.

Try us. If we're not obviously better, keep your current one.
But honestly? You won't want to go back."
```

### When Customer Compares to Netflix
```
"Netflix is great, but it doesn't have live TV.
No sports, no news, no African channels.

DASH TV+ has everything Netflix has (for VOD), PLUS live TV, sports, and 700+ channels.

If you want the full entertainment package? You need both.
But if you can only pick one for Guinea, DASH TV+ gives you 90% more than Netflix."
```

### When Customer Says "Too Expensive"
```
"What are you paying now? [They say: 150k for cable]

DASH TV+ is 35k. That's 115k LESS. Not more - less.
You'll save money while getting better service.

If you're really tight on budget, our Essentiel plan is 15k for 200 channels.
Still saves you 135k/month."
```

## OBJECTION HANDLING VIA COMPARISON

**"Isn't this just like other IPTV?"**
```
No, and here's why: Other IPTV you get from a "revendeur" - a middleman.
They buy access to some generic player, add content, and resell.
Quality is whatever, support is "email if you're lucky."

DASH TV+ - we built the app ourselves. Professional team, local support, Guinean focus.
It's not comparable. Like comparing a street vendor's phone to Apple.
```

**"Why should I trust you vs Cable?"**
```
Cable is safe, yes. But expensive and limiting.
You're taking a risk with ANY new service. That's why we offer 24h FREE trial.
Test us. See the quality. See the channels. See the speed.
No credit card, no commitment. Just try and decide.

50+ Guineans have done this. Most switched. None regretted.
```

**"Isn't Cable more reliable?"**
```
Cable is reliable, true. But DASH TV+ is also 99.5% reliable.
And honestly? Your internet in Guinea is probably the limiting factor, not us.
DASH TV+ adapts to whatever speed you have - slower connection = slightly lower quality, but still works.
Cable can't do that.
```
