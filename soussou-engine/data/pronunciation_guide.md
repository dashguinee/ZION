## Sound System Overview

### Quick Facts

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Vowels | 7 basic vowels (all can be long or short) |
| Tones | 2 levels (High, Low) |
| Special Consonants | kh, gb, ng, nd, mb, ny |
| Writing Systems | Latin (primary), Arabic (Ajami), N'Ko |

### The Challenge

People write Soussou phonetically based on what they hear, creating many spelling variants:

```
"I'm coming" can be written as:
- N'na fafé
- Nna fafe
- Na Fafé
- na fafeh
- NNA FAFE

All are valid and mean the same thing!
```

## Vowel Sounds

### The Seven Vowels

Soussou has seven distinct vowel sounds:

| IPA | Common Spellings | Sound Description | Example |
|-----|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| i | i | "ee" in "feet" | **di** (child) |
| e | e, é | "ay" in "day" | **be** (who) |
| ɛ | ɛ, e, è | "e" in "bet" | **gìnɛ́** (woman) |
| a | a | "a" in "father" | **na** (is) |
| ɔ | ɔ, o, ò | "o" in "thought" | **ɔ** |
| o | o, ó | "o" in "go" | **wo** (you pl.) |
| u | u, ou | "oo" in "food" | **mu** (not) |

### Vowel Length Matters!

Vowel length is **phonemic** - it changes meaning:

| Short | Long | Difference |
|-------|------|------------|
| Standard pronunciation | Doubled or lengthened | Changes word meaning |

Written representations:
- **Doubled letters**: aa, ee, ii, oo, uu
- **Macron**: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū
- **Often unmarked** in casual writing

### Vowel Spelling Variants

The same vowel may be written many ways:

| Sound | Possible Spellings | Normalize To |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| e | e, é, è, ê, ë | e |
| a | a, à, â, ä | a |
| o | o, ó, ò, ô, ö | o |
| u | u, ú, ù, û, ü, ou | u |
| i | i, í, ì, î, ï | i |

## Consonant Sounds

### Basic Consonants

| Sound | Written As | Examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| p, b, t, d, k, g | Same | **bara** (has), **tana** (three) |
| f, v, s, z | Same | **fafé** (coming), **siga** (go) |
| m, n | Same | **ma** (my), **na** (is) |
| l, w, y | Same | **kolon** (know), **wo** (you) |

### Special Consonant Clusters

These are crucial for correct Soussou pronunciation:

#### kh - Aspirated/Fricative K

| Written | Pronunciation | Regional Note |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| kh | [kʰ] or [x] | Conakry: more fricative; Rural: more aspirated |

Examples: **khafé** (situation), **kha** (possessive), **khili** (call), **khere** (peace)

How to say it:
- Like "k" with extra breath (aspirated)
- OR like German "ch" in "Bach" (fricative)
- Some regions use simple "k"

#### gb - Labial-Velar

| Written | Pronunciation | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| gb | [ɡ͡b] | Single sound, not "g" + "b" |

Examples: **gbo** (big/a lot), **sogbè**

How to say it:
- Say "g" and "b" simultaneously
- Lips round while back of tongue touches velum
- Common in West African languages

#### ng - Velar Nasal

| Written | Pronunciation | Position |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| ng, ŋ | [ŋ] | Usually medial/final |

Examples: **bangui** (house), **tongo** (take)

How to say it:
- Like "ng" in "sing"
- NOT like "ng" in "finger" (no separate "g")

#### nd, mb - Prenasalized Stops

| Written | Pronunciation | Examples |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| nd | [ⁿd] | **mindé** (where) |
| mb | [ᵐb] | Various words |

How to say it:
- Brief nasal before the stop
- Single phoneme, not two sounds

#### ny - Palatal Nasal

| Written | Pronunciation | Alternate Spellings |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| ny, ɲ, gn | [ɲ] | All represent same sound |

How to say it:
- Like "ny" in "canyon"
- Like Spanish "ñ"

## Tone System

### Two Tones

Soussou uses two basic tones that distinguish meaning:

| Tone | Mark | Symbol | How to Say |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| High | Acute | á | Higher pitch |
| Low | Grave | à | Lower pitch |

### Tone Changes Meaning

| Word | Tone Pattern | Meaning |
|------|-------------|---------|
| túlí | HH | ear |
| kérì | HL | hoe |
| gìnɛ́ | LH | woman |

### Tonal Processes

1. **Neutralization-by-Copy**: In compounds, tones spread between words
2. **Affaissement** (Settling): LH becomes LL before high words
3. **Tone Raising**: HL becomes HH in certain positions

### Written Tone Marking

| Context | How Tone is Marked |
|---------|-------------------|
| Formal/linguistic | Diacritical marks (á, à) |
| Informal/casual | Usually unmarked |
| Voice input | Must infer from context |

## Fast Speech Patterns

### Common Contractions

When people speak quickly, sounds get dropped or merged:

#### Vowel Deletion

| Slow Speech | Fast Speech | Meaning |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| faxamu | faxmu | understand |
| adamadi | adamdi | human |

#### Final Vowel Reduction

| Slow Speech | Fast Speech | Meaning |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| fafé | faf | coming |
| kolon | koln | know |

#### Double Consonant Simplification

| Slow Speech | Fast Speech | Meaning |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| nna | na | (contraction) |
| mma | ma | my |

#### Pronoun Contractions

| Full Form | Contracted | Fast Speech |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| n + tan | Ntan | ntan, tan |
| i + tan | Itan | itan, tan |
| n + na | N'na | nna, na |

### What Gets Dropped

In order of frequency:
1. **Trailing 'h'**: fafeh → fafe
2. **Apostrophes** (indicate elision already happened)
3. **Accent marks**: fafé → fafe
4. **Double consonants**: compress to single
5. **Unstressed vowels**: deleted entirely

## Voice Recognition Tips

### Normalization Pipeline

Apply these steps to any input before matching:

```javascript
function normalizeForMatching(input) {
  return input
    .toLowerCase()                           // 1. Lowercase
    .normalize('NFD')                         // 2. Decompose accents
    .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, '')          // 3. Remove diacritics
    .replace(/[''`]/g, '')                    // 4. Remove apostrophes
    .replace(/(.)\1+/g, '$1')                 // 5. Compress doubles
    .replace(/h$/, '')                        // 6. Remove trailing h
    .trim();
}
```

### Phonetic Equivalence Sets

Treat these as equivalent when matching:

| Category | Equivalents |
|----------|-------------|
| E-sounds | é, è, e, ɛ |
| O-sounds | ó, ò, o, ɔ |
| K-sounds | kh, k, x |
| N-sounds | ng, n, ŋ |
| NY-sounds | ny, gn, ɲ |

### Confidence Scoring

When a spoken word matches multiple possibilities:

| Match Type | Confidence | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Exact | 1.0 | Perfect normalized match |
| Phonetic | 0.9 | Same sound, different spelling |
| Regional | 0.85 | Known regional variant |
| Fast Speech | 0.8 | Recognized contraction |
| Partial | 0.6 | Part of word matches |

**Minimum threshold**: 0.6

### Context Disambiguation

Some sounds have multiple meanings - use context:

#### "mma" can mean:

| Interpretation | Context Clue |
|----------------|--------------|
| M'ma (my) | Followed by noun |
| m'ma (not) | Followed by verb |

Example:
- "M'ma woto fafé" = **My** car is coming
- "Ntan m'ma kolon" = I **don't** know

#### "na" can mean:

| Interpretation | Context Clue |
|----------------|--------------|
| na (locative/copula) | General use |
| N'na (I am) | Before action verb |

### Handling French Code-Switching

French words in Soussou speech are **normal and authentic**:

**Indicators of French**:
- Uvular r [ʁ]
- Nasal vowels
- French morphology
- Common French words

**How to Handle**:
- Accept as valid Soussou
- Don't try to "correct" to pure Soussou
- Recognize hybrid forms (French root + Soussou suffix)

Example: "comprendfé" = French "comprend" + Soussou "-fé"

| na | n'a, nna, Na, N'na |
| mma | M'ma, ma, m'ma |
| khere | khèré, khereh, Khéré |
| kolon | kolon, kolón, koloñ |

### Minimal Pairs to Watch

Words that sound similar but mean different things:

|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| na (copula) | is | n'a (contraction) | I have |
| ma (poss.) | my | mu (neg.) | not |
| be (who) | who | bɛ (variant) | who |

### Regional Pronunciation Quick Guide

| Sound | Conakry | Rural | Sierra Leone |
|-------|---------|-------|--------------|
| kh | [x] | [kʰ] | varies |
| Final V | often dropped | preserved | varies |

2. Use phonetic equivalence sets for fuzzy matching
3. Score confidence based on match type
4. Use context to disambiguate homophonous forms
5. Accept French loanwords and hybrids

### For Text-to-Speech

1. Mark tones if targeting linguistic accuracy
2. Use regional pronunciation rules
3. Handle kh, gb, ng correctly
4. Implement appropriate speech rate for region
