## Data Reliability Assessment

### HIGH Reliability
- SIL/Ethnologue data
- Peer-reviewed academic papers (Mandenkan journal)
- Published grammars (Houis 1963, Toure 2004)
- Academic institution resources (IU, UW-Madison)
- Peace Corps language materials
- Bible translation organizations

### MEDIUM-HIGH Reliability
- Omniglot (well-researched but not peer-reviewed)
- Languages and Numbers
- Wikipedia (cross-referenced)

### MEDIUM Reliability
- Community dictionaries (Glosbe, Lughayangu)
- Online forums and polyglot sites

## Notes on Data Quality

1. **Tone marking**: Not all sources consistently mark tone. Academic sources (Green et al. 2013) use systematic tone marking while practical resources (Peace Corps) often omit it.

2. **Orthographic variation**: Multiple spelling conventions exist due to:
   - Pre-1988 vs post-1988 orthography
   - French vs English transcription conventions
   - Variation between Latin, Arabic, and N'Ko scripts

3. **Dialectal variation**: Some vocabulary differs between:
   - "Vrai Soussou" (village/traditional)
   - Urban/Conakry Susu
   - Honorific vs common registers

4. **French loanwords**: Normal and expected in Susu due to:
   - Colonial history
   - French as official language of Guinea
   - Educational and administrative domains

## Recommended Primary Sources for Future Research

1. **Houis (1963)** - Most comprehensive grammar
2. **Green et al. (2013)** - Best tonal analysis
3. **Peace Corps materials** - Best practical vocabulary
4. **Toure (2004)** - Culture and language combined

## Access Notes

- Some Ethnologue data requires subscription
- Peace Corps PDF was too large to fully extract (503 error)
- Many Wikipedia and Polyglot Club pages blocked (403 errors)
- UDHR Susu text available at efele.net
