## Phonology

### Vowels

Susu has a **seven-vowel system** with phonemic length contrast:

| Front | Central | Back |
|-------|---------|------|
| i     |         | u    |
| e     |         | o    |
| ɛ     |         | ɔ    |
|       | a       |      |

- All seven vowels can be short or long
- Vowel length is phonemic (changes word meaning)
- Open-mid vowels ɛ and ɔ are written with special characters in the Latin orthography

### Consonants

The consonant inventory includes:
- **Stops**: Voicing contrast (p/b, t/d, k/g)
- **Nasals**: m, n, ɲ, ŋ
- **Fricatives**: f/v, s/z
- **Approximants**: l, w, y

Notable feature: Voicing is contrastive for both stops and fricatives.

### Tone System

Susu is a **two-tone language**:
- **High (H)**: marked with acute accent (á)
- **Low (L)**: marked with grave accent (à)

**Tone Bearing Unit (TBU)**: The mora serves as the fundamental unit for tone assignment.

| Pattern | Example | Translation |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| HH | túlí | ear |
| HL | kérì | hoe |
| LH | ɡìnɛ́ | woman |

## Grammar

### Word Order

Susu is an **SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)** language:

```
N    kérì   to
I    hoe    see
"I see the hoe"
```

### Noun Phrase Structure

- **Possessor-Noun**: Possessive precedes noun
- **Noun-Determiner**: Demonstratives follow noun
- **Suffixing**: Generally suffixing morphology
- **No articles**: No definite or indefinite articles

### Pronouns

#### Subject Pronouns

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | n (I) | won (we, incl.) / muxu (we, excl.) |
| 2nd | i (you) | wo (you pl.) |
| 3rd | a (he/she/it) | e (they) |

Note: First person plural has **inclusive** (won - includes addressee) and **exclusive** (muxu - excludes addressee) forms.

#### Possessive Construction

The possessive pronoun precedes the noun. The 1sg pronoun changes from **n** to **m** before certain consonants:

| Susu | English |
|------|---------|
| m baba | my father |
| i baba | your (sg) father |
| a baba | his/her/its father |
| wom baba | our father |
| wo baba | your (pl) father |
| e baba | their father |

### Pluralization

The plural is formed by adding the clitic **-e** or **-yè** to the noun:

- túlí (ear) → túléè (ears)
- kérì (hoe) → kérèè (hoes)

When the suffix attaches to vowel-final roots, it creates derived long vowels.

### Negation

Sentential negation is expressed with the particle **mu**:

```
N  mu  a  faxamuxi
I  NEG it understand
"I don't understand"
```

The distribution of mu varies - with adjectival predicates it sometimes appears to infix, while with transitive verbs it typically precedes the object.

### Verb Morphology

Verbs are conjugated for **tense, aspect, and mood** using:
- Prefixes
- Suffixes
- Tone changes

The language uses **aspect markers** rather than traditional tense conjugations. Notable markers include:
- **bara** / **bata** - accomplished/perfective aspect (similar to Yalunka and Maninka)

Susu relies on clause order to define grammatical function rather than extensive morphological marking.

### Question Words

Susu is **wh-in-situ** - question words remain in their canonical position:

| Susu | English |
|------|---------|
| nde | who/some |
| munse | what |

Examples:
- i nde to? "Who did you see?"
- a munse don ma? "What will you eat?"

## Tonal Processes

### Neutralization-by-Copy (NBC)

In nominal compounds, the final lexical tone of the first element copies to the first TBU of the second element. This creates predictable surface melodies like HH.HL or LL.HL.

### Affaissement (Tone Settling)

LH sequences become LL before high-toned words.

### Tone Raising (RAI)

HL sequences become HH under specific prosodic conditions.

### Prosodic Structure

Evidence suggests binary, right-aligned tonal feet organize tone-bearing units, influencing both neutralization and spreading operations.

## Writing Systems

### 1. Latin Script (Primary)

First developed by missionary John Godfrey Wilhelm in the early 19th century. The current standardized orthography was adopted in 1988 following the African reference alphabet conventions under the government of Ahmed Sekou Toure.

Special characters: ɛ, ɔ, ɲ, ŋ

Tone marking appears to be optional in standard orthography.

### 2. Arabic Script (Ajami)

Traditional writing system, possibly introduced during the Imamate of Futa Jallon. Still used by some communities.

### 3. N'Ko Script

Pan-Mande alphabet created by Solomana Kante in 1949. Used by some Susu speakers who also read Mandinka or Bambara in N'Ko.

### 4. Adlam Script

A newer alphabetic script that has some adoption among Susu speakers.

## Dialectal Variation

### "Vrai Soussou"

In traditional village Susu, different words are used for body parts when referring to respected people (parents, elders) versus oneself or peers. This honorific vocabulary system reflects social relationships.

## Historical Linguistics

### Etymology of Language Name

The name "Susu" is believed to derive from the word **Susuwi**, meaning "horseman" or "horse."

## Comparison with Yalunka

Susu and Yalunka are sister languages in the Susu-Yalunka branch:

| Feature | Susu | Yalunka |
|---------|------|---------|
| Perfective marker | bara | bata |
| Phonological rules | Apply to basic pronouns | Apply regardless of pronoun |
| Aspect marker system | Similar | Similar |

Both languages share the characteristic West African terraced downstep in tonality.

## Cultural Notes

### Greeting Customs

Extended greetings are culturally important. Questions about well-being (Tana mu fɛɛn? / Hɛri fɛɛn?) expect the response "Tana yo mu fɛɛn" (no misfortune).

Physical greetings vary: handshake (most common), hugging, bowing, genuflecting (to elders).

It is culturally appropriate to wait to be asked one's name rather than offering it spontaneously.

### Trade Language

Susu has historically functioned as a lingua franca for trade along the Guinea coast, particularly in the southwest region including the capital Conakry.
