## 1. Basic Word Order

Soussou is an **SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)** language.

```
Subject + Object + Verb
```

**Example**:
- "I munse don ma?" = "What will you eat?" (lit: "you what eat PRES")

### Additional Word Order Features

- **Poss-N**: Possessor precedes Noun
- **N-D**: Noun precedes Determiner
- **Suffixing**: Generally suffixing language
- **Wh-in-situ**: Question words remain in their grammatical position (do not move to sentence front)
- **Non-pro-drop**: Pronouns cannot be omitted

## 2. Pronoun System

### 2.1 Subject Pronouns

#### Singular
| Person | Pronoun | English |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 1st | n / m | I |
| 2nd | i | you |
| 3rd | a | he/she/it |

#### Plural
| Person | Pronoun | English | Note |
|--------|---------|---------|------|
| 1st (exclusive) | muxu | we | Listener NOT included |
| 1st (inclusive) | won | we | Listener included |
| 2nd | wo | you (pl.) | |
| 3rd | e | they | |

**Important**: The 1st person plural has an **inclusive/exclusive distinction**:
- **muxu** = "we" (but not you, the listener)
- **won** = "we" (including you, the listener)

### 2.2 Object Pronouns

Subject pronouns also serve as object pronouns in Soussou.

### 2.3 Possessive Constructions

Possessive pronouns are used with "natural possessions" such as:
- Body parts
- Family relationships

**Examples**:
- "n baba" = "my father"
- "n nga" = "my mother"

---

## 3. Noun System

### 3.1 No Noun Classes or Gender

Unlike many African languages (e.g., Bantu languages), Soussou has:
- **No noun classes**
- **No grammatical gender**
- **No definite or indefinite articles**

### 3.2 Plural Formation

**Rule**: Add **-e** to the singular form

The plural marker is a **clitic** that attaches to the last element of the noun phrase (noun or determiner).

**Important Constraint**: The plural marker does NOT co-occur with numerals.

**Examples**:
- Singular + -e = Plural
- When using numerals (keren, firin, etc.), no plural marker is needed

---

## 4. Verb System

### 4.1 No Verb Agreement

Soussou verbs have **no agreement affixes** - the verb form does not change based on subject.

### 4.2 Tense, Aspect, and Mood (TAM)

Verbs are conjugated for tense, aspect, and mood using a combination of:
- Prefixes
- Suffixes
- Tone changes

#### Verb Suffixes
| Suffix | Function |
|--------|----------|
| -ma | Tense/aspect marker |
| -xi | Tense/aspect marker |
| -fe | Tense/aspect marker |
| -∅ | Zero marker |

#### Object Markers
| Marker | Function |
|--------|----------|
| bara | Object/aspect marker |
| naxaa | Object marker |
| xa | Object marker |
| naxab | Object marker |
| nu | Object marker |
| na | Object marker |

### 4.3 The Completive Marker "bara"

**bara** functions as a **completive/accomplished aspect** marker, similar to a perfective.

**Example**:
- "n bara ginE dçxç" = "I have..." (completed action)

### 4.4 Verbal Prefixes

Soussou has two highly productive verbal prefixes that modify verb meaning:

#### The mà- Prefix (Multiplicative/Distributive)

Creates meanings of repeated or distributed actions from telic verbs.

| Base Verb | Prefixed Form | Base Meaning | Prefixed Meaning |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| bɔ̀nbɔ́ | màbɔ́nbɔ̀ | beat (once) | beat many times |
| gbàlàntín | màgbálàntìn | tear out | tear out many objects |
| xábá | màxábà | cut | shear, peel |
| sùxú | màsúxù | catch | gather, collect |
| kɔ̀ɔ́ | màkɔ́ɔ̀ | take down | sweep |

**Semantic Requirements for mà-**:
- **Multiplicative proper**: transitive telic verbs expressing brief events with no irreversible result
- **Multiplicative distributive**: transitive telic verbs expressing brief events with irreversible result

#### The rà- Prefix (Causative/Applicative)

Adds a new agent participant to the argument structure, primarily deriving causatives from intransitive verbs.

| Base Verb | Prefixed Form | Base Meaning | Prefixed Meaning |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| dúlá | ràdúlà | drown (intr.) | sink (tr.) |
| gààxú | ràgááxù | be afraid | frighten |
| fúntú | ràfúntù | swell | inflate |

**Etymology**: Both prefixes have corresponding postpositions (má and rá) with common etymologies deriving from nouns with locative meanings.

---

## 5. Negation

### The Negation Particle "mu"

Sentential negation is expressed with the particle **mu**.

**Distribution** (variable):
- With **adjectival predicates**: sometimes appears to infix
- With **transitive verbs**: placed before the object

---

## 6. Question Formation

### 6.1 Wh-Questions

Soussou is **wh-in-situ** - question words stay in their normal grammatical position.

#### Question Words
| Soussou | English | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| munse | what | "i munse don ma?" = "What will you eat?" |
| nde | who | "i nde to?" = "Who did you see?" |
| minde | where | (location questions) |

### 6.2 Yes/No Questions

Questions can be formed through intonation and/or particles.

---

## 7. Copula and Predication

### The Copula "na"

**na** functions as the copula ("is/am/are"), particularly with:
- Occupations
- Nationalities

**Example**:
- "N na..." = "I am..."

---

## 8. Conjunctions

### Coordinating Conjunction "nun"

**nun** = "and"

**Example from UDHR**:
- "Fondoe **nun** faxamui na e bɛ" = "Reason **and** conscience..."

---

## 9. Demonstratives

### Proximal and Distal

| Type | Soussou | English |
|------|---------|---------|
| Proximal | yi | this (near speaker) |
| Distal | na | that (far from speaker) |

### Definite Article

The suffix **-i** functions as a definite article, likely derived from a demonstrative.

---

## 10. Postpositions

Soussou uses **postpositions** rather than prepositions (following the head-final nature of SOV languages).

| Postposition | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| ra | locative/directional |
| ma | locative/on |
| ye | at/to |

---

## 11. Phonology

### 11.1 Vowel System

Seven vowel phonemes with length distinction:

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| a | open front unrounded |
| e | close-mid front unrounded |
| ɛ | open-mid front unrounded |
| i | close front unrounded |
| o | close-mid back rounded |
| ɔ | open-mid back rounded |
| u | close back rounded |

**Features**:
- Vowel length is contrastive (short vs. long)
- Nasal vowels exist
- Length can change word meaning

### 11.2 Consonant System

Categories include:
- Stops (voiced/voiceless contrast)
- Nasals
- Fricatives (voiced/voiceless contrast)
- Approximants

**Special consonants**:
- x = voiceless velar fricative
- gb = labial-velar stop
- ŋ = velar nasal

### 11.3 Tone System

Soussou is a **tonal language** with three tones:
- **High**
- **Mid**
- **Low**

**Tone is phonemic** - changing tone changes meaning.

**Orthography**: Tone marking is optional in written Soussou.
