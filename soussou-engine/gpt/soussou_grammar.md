# Soussou Grammar Guide

## Word Order: SOAM Pattern

Soussou uses **Subject-Object-Action-Modifier** order (not SVO like English).

```
SUBJECT + OBJECT/CONTEXT + ACTION/VERB + MODIFIER
```

**Examples:**
- Ntan itan situation comprendfé = I understand your situation
- Ana akha woto fafé = His car is coming
- Ntan kolon itan khafé = I know your situation

## Pronoun System

### Subject Pronouns

| Soussou | English | French |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Ntan | I/me | Je/moi |
| Itan | You | Tu/toi |
| Ana | He/She | Il/Elle |
| Whon | We | Nous |
| Etan | They | Ils/Elles |

### Possession Markers

| Soussou | English | French |
|---------|---------|--------|
| M'ma | My | Mon/ma |
| Akha | His/Her | Son/sa |
| Whonma | Our | Notre |
| Ekha | Their | Leur |

Note: "Your" uses `Itan` directly (Itan khafé = your situation)

---

## Movement Pattern (fafé)

Express "coming" or "on the way":

| Soussou | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| N'na fafé | I'm coming |
| Ina fafé | You're coming |
| Ana fafé | He/She is coming |
| Whon' fafé | We're coming |
| Etan fafé | They're coming |

With possession:
- M'ma woto fafé = My car is coming
- Akha bateau fafé = His boat is coming

---

## Negation Pattern (m'ma)

Insert `m'ma` between subject and verb:

```
PRONOUN + m'ma + VERB = "don't/doesn't"
```

| Soussou | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Ntan m'ma kolon | I don't know |
| Ina m'ma fafé | You're not coming |
| Ana m'ma kolon | He/She doesn't know |
| Etan m'ma fafé | They're not coming |

**Important:** `m'ma` before verb = negation; `m'ma` before noun = "my"

---

## Question Patterns

### Yes/No Questions
Same structure + rising intonation:
- Ina fafé? = Are you coming?
- Itan kolon? = Do you know?

### Location Questions (mindé = where)
- Ina mindé? = Where are you?
- Akha woto mindé? = Where is his car?

### "What about?" Questions (go/ngo)
- N'na fafé, itan go? = I'm coming, what about you?
- Itan ngo? = And you?

### Status Questions

```

Negation: `Ntan m'ma no'mma fafé` = I can't come

## Cultural Notes

1. **Code-switching is natural** - Mixing Soussou and French is authentic
2. **Sound over spelling** - No official written form; accept phonetic variants
3. **Casual register** - Most phrases are informal/friendly
4. **Tone-dependent** - Same structure can be statement or question
